It teaches basic techniques for creating 3D computer animations.\nTechnical requirements and software  A computer with good performance is desirable. Preferably with a good discrete GPU (NVidia or AMD).  Autodesk Maya - preferred 3D software, an industry standard. To obtain in for learning purposes, please apply for a student account on the official Autodesk site here.  Course structure The lectures and exercises and thought together, in an interactive way. The laboratory exercises are on a weekly basis.\nThe syllabus is structured as follows:\n Introduction, history and overview of the field. Introduction to the 3D environment, basic concepts and interface overview. Concepts of 3D modeling. Polygonal, NURBS and subdivision modeling. UV coordinates. Deformations and rigging. Animation. Materials and textures. Lightning and camera. Rendering and compositing Scripting and the 3D pipeline.  The full syllabus is available at: https://finki.ukim.mk/sites/default/files/kompjuterska_animacija.pdf\nGrading and assessments The course is oriented towards independent working. You must attend the laboratory exercises to be able to complete the course. Only one absence from the laboratory exercises is tolerated.\nThe final grade is calculated as follows:\n laboratory exercises (20%) - presented weekly. homework assignments (20%) - 2 homeworks during the semester. midterm (1st partial) exam (20%) - done once in the middle of the semester. project work (40%) - agreed with the teachers. It can be submitted in one of the three exam sessions. Accordingly there is a penalty for each following session:  up to 100% if finished in the 1st exam session (June/July). Translates up to 40% percent of the total points. up to 90% if finished in the 2nd exam session (August/September). Translates up to 36% of the total points. up to 75% if finished in the 3rd exam session (January/February). Translates up to 30% of the total points.    The project is mandatory and students can not pass the course without submitting it.\nCourse materials  Available on the faculty moodle instance.
