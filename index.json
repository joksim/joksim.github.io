It teaches basic techniques for creating 3D computer animations.\nCourse structure The lectures and exercises and thought together, in an interactive way. The laboratory exercises are on a weekly basis.\nThe syllabus is structured as follows:\n Introduction, history and overview of the field. Introduction to the 3D environment (Autodesk Maya), basic concepts and interface overview. Concepts of 3D modeling. Polygonal, NURBS and subdivision modeling. UV coordinates. Deformations and rigging. Animation. Materials and textures. Lightning and camera. Rendering and compositing Intro to scripting and the 3D pipeline.  The full syllabus is available at: https://finki.ukim.mk/sites/default/files/kompjuterska_animacija.pdf\nGrading and assessments The course is oriented towards independent working. You must attend the laboratory exercises to be able to complete the course. Only one absence from the laboratory exercises is tolerated.\nThe final grade is calculated as follows:\n laboratory exercises (20%) - presented weekly. homework assignments (20%) - 2 homeworks during the semester. 1st partial exam (20%) - done once in the middle of the semester. project work (40%) - agreed with the teachers. It can be finished in one of the three seesions.
